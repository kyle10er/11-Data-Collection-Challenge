# Unit 11 Homework: Mission to Mars

The homework instructions and requirements are located in Canvas (or in the 08-Canvas folder for those cohorts not on Canvas).

This repo was created to address the 11-Data-Collection challenge for the UPENN/EdX data science and visualization bootcmap.  Using past lessons and homework I answered the questions asked.  I used BeautifulSoup to scrape a given site for facts about Mars and organized the data according to the prompts given.  I consulted chatgpt 3.5 for syntax issues and to spell check the code that I had written.
